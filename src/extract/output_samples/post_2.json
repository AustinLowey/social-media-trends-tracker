They came back to Finland after being with Cirque Du Soleil for over 5 years as a trapeze artist, including getting a husband from there. They setup a business with the intention of developing Finnish circus culture and got some funding from a project which got some EU funding - so thats why there is the placard. It's sort of \"*Huh... Neat!*\" thing - but fact is that they basically paid and largely built everything on their own hands. Their business does alright and they been at it for over 10 years now (pandemic did hit hard, but that went for all of culture sector).\n\nBut there are placards like this all over the place. Public parks, park benches, bridges, roads, highways. I think the local library has a music room you can rent to rehearse in, which has a small sign like this next to it, because EU gave funding to buy the piano or smth.\n\nI actually like the fact that these signs exist, mainly because Finland is quite remote and far from EU/\"Europe\" and basically an Island in relation to it. So seeing these kinda like shows that we are actually part of something. And some of them are nice. They are in the process of restoring bit of a local riverbank to get rid of invasive species and bring back native flowers for pollinators - some EU green corridor/belt/whatever project. The area is still under work as it takes quite few ears to get the plants to grow and sustain themselves. But it is a pleasant thing to walk past. This totally wouldn't have happened if it had to be funded only by the city.",
