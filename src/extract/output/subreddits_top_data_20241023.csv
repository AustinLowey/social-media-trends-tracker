AmazonSeller,1g8kucr,9,"Crazy deductions from sales-: I’m a new seller and only have one product that I created..
Had a bunch of sales earlier this month..
Then after all of Amazon’s taxes and coupon redemption fees etc. and Advertizing ended up with Zero .
Seems like their way of describing stuff is tricky.
For example I selected “coupon does not stack” but they still double charged me discounts such as prime discount in addition to coupon discount ..
Then I had some international listing.
They didn’t tell me they were going to charge me a subscription fee but then it shows up.
In addition to all the other fees.
Seems like their system is so confusing purposefully…

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

When I contact Amazon support, I get conflicting advice on how to handle return authorization requests. I have just ignored them completely.

Is it even worth messaging the customer to try and resolve these issues directly? Honestly, the return portal seems pretty useless. The only productive thing I’ve found is managing A-to-Z claims when buyers say the order wasn’t delivered, even though I have proof it was. I get refunded on those.

Does anyone have a practical system for managing returns efficiently? Also, when a buyer generates a return label (at my expense) but never ships the item back, does Amazon refund me for the cost of the unused label? Any insights would be appreciated.",honeybee8388,"2024-10-21, 19:08, Monday"

When you sell items through printify, aren’t you selling custom designs? Unique designs? Aren’t you the only seller selling those specific designs? 
Or are you selling designs that other sellers are also selling the same exact item?

Also one of the most important factors for the buy box is FBA, where the product is stored at an Amazon warehouse and is ready to ship, with a delivery date of same day in same cases maybe 1-2 days delivery time..

FBA gives you immediate buy box access as it's shipped by Amazon. The only thing that happens if you don't get the buy box or, at least buy box eligiblity is that you need to go on the Amazon forums and message one of the mods their who manage the buy box.

It also depends on the stock count of the sellers the one with a larger inventory is more likely to win.

It's better to keep your price the same as theirs or just lower it by 0.5 cents.

**Correcting common myths and misinformation**

* **Arbitrage / OA / RA** - It is neither all allowed nor all disallowed on Amazon. Their policies determine what circumstances are allowable and how it has to be handled by the seller.

* **""First sale doctrine""** - This is often misunderstood and misapplied. It is not a blanket exception from Amazon policies or a license to force OA allowance in any manner desired. Arbitrage is allowable but must comply with Amazon policies. They do not want retail purchases resold on their platform (mis)represented as 'new' or their customers having issues like warranties not being honored due to original purchaser confusion. For some brands and categories, an invoice is *required* to qualify and a retail receipt does not comply.

* **Receipts and invoices** - A retail receipt is NOT an invoice. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). In cases where an invoice is required by Amazon, the invoice MUST meet Amazon's specific requirements. ""Someone I know successfully used a receipt and..."", well congratulations to them. That does not change Amazon's policies, that invoice policy enforcement is increasing, and that scenarios requiring a compliant invoice are growing.

* **Target receipts** - Some scenarios allow receipts and a Target receipt will comply. For those categories and ungating cases where an *invoice* is required, Target retail receipts DO NOT comply with Amazon's invoice requirements. Someone you know getting away with submitting a receipt once (or more) does not mean it's the same category or scenario as someone else, nor does it change Amazon's policies or their growing enforcement of them.

* **Paid courses and buyer groups** - In most cases, they're a scam. Avoid. Amazon's Seller University is the best place to start.

AmazonSeller,1g99f4x,1,"This post mentions ungating, category approval, branding, brand approval, invoices, arbitrage, or a commonly related scenario. 

### Amazon policy, info, and enrollement pages

The following Amazon Seller pages are provided to ensure the most accurate info is the basis for discussion

**Brand owner registry** 

* Getting started - https://sell.amazon.com/brand-registry    
* Overview - https://sell.amazon.com/blog/what-is-amazon-brand-registry   
* Requirements and eligibility - https://brandservices.amazon.com/brandregistry/eligibility

**Brand seller ungating**

* Category Requirements - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/G200316110
* Restricted Products - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/200164330
* Categories and Products requiring approval (see link to video within for invoice requirements) - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/200333160) 

### The most common ungating / invoice problems

* **Failing to do the homework** - take your business seriously and read Amazon's policies and requirements for yourself. Skipping the research before acting, stumbling through things asking forgiveness later, is setting yourself up to fail on Amazon. 

* **Misunderstanding what an invoice is** - an invoice and a receipt are NOT the same thing. [**See this article to learn the difference**](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/invoicing/invoice-vs-receipt/). 

* **Failure to provide a real invoice** -  often due to providing a receipt under the mistaken assumption it works as an invoice.  Homemade invoices, 3rd party invoices, and other deceptive efforts will not pass Amazon verification and will result in a closure of your account

* **Failure to provide an invoice from a proper source** - it should come from a wholesaler or distributor for the brand, NOT a retail outlet

* **Failure to provide a compliant invoice** - non-compliant and partially compliant invoices will not work. If the invoice you submit does not have all the info which Amazon requires, it will not be approved.

* **Following out of date / bad advice** - often coming from youtube or people online posing as a guru

* **Assuming someone else's anecdote determines all scenarios** - *""...but someone said they used a receipt for an invoice and it worked""*. Not all cases and categories are the same or they may have just been lucky. Their anecdote does not change or invalidate Amazon's stated policies. It does not change that Amazon is becoming increasingly more strict with category and brand approval policies and its enforcment of them. 

* **Acting in bad faith** - In growing frequency, Amazon is acting on accounts which fail to provide correct documentation per stated requirements, especially attempts to submit falsified documentation and other types of bad faith engagement. Trying to game Amazon's policies or engage with them while not giving full attention to their policies can be a fast way to get your account restricted

Again, **a receipt and an invoice are NOT the same thing**. If the category or brand approval requires an invoice, a retail receipt does not meet Amazon's stated *invoice* requirements. Obtain a compliant invoice when an invoice is required

**Key Fundamentals You Can Apply to Your Amazon Products:**

**1) Campaign Structure -** 80% of the campaigns I manage are single-keyword campaigns—and for good reason. One of the biggest mistakes sellers make is mismanaging placements, which leads to inefficient PPC optimization. By structuring your campaigns this way, you can optimize placements more effectively (I've detailed this further in the post below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/1bw8y5d/many\_amazon\_sellers\_mismanage\_their\_ppc\_with\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/1bw8y5d/many_amazon_sellers_mismanage_their_ppc_with_the/)

2) **Budget allocation** - at least half of your budget should be focused on ranking campaigns targeting your most relevant keywords. The sales generated from these campaigns is what drives your organic growth.

3) **Wasted Ad Spend - a** common source of wasted ad spend comes from running too many broad or automatic discovery campaigns without proper negative targeting. To minimize wasted spend, limit your budget for these campaigns and implement strong negative targeting to keep waste at a minimum.

4) **Ranking Campaigns -** don’t be afraid to run ranking campaigns at a higher ACoS than average. For example, one of our campaigns ran at an ""unprofitable ACoS"" but helped us achieve strong product ranking and significant organic sales growth.

5) **Bids & Placements -** proper bid and placement optimization is the main lever in Amazon PPC. I recommend optimizing your ads 2-3 times a week or daily, while focusing on the highest converting placements in any campaign. Keep a close eye on your organic ranking and overall sales performance. Analyze weekly trends and adjust your campaigns accordingly",fleech26,"2024-10-20, 00:53, Sunday"

One of the biggest mistakes sellers make is mismanaging placements, which leads to inefficient PPC optimization. By structuring your campaigns this way, you can optimize placements more effectively (I've detailed this further in the post below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/1bw8y5d/many\_amazon\_sellers\_mismanage\_their\_ppc\_with\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/1bw8y5d/many_amazon_sellers_mismanage_their_ppc_with_the/)

2) **Budget allocation** - at least half of your budget should be focused on ranking campaigns targeting your most relevant keywords. The sales generated from these campaigns is what drives your organic growth. Sp

High-level budget allocation: - 70% sponsored product ads, 20% - sponsored brand (video) ads, 10% sponsored display. Out of the 70% of total budget you're spending on sponsored products campaign, I'd like to have majority of it going towards ranking campaigns and at an high acos (provided they get conversion rate).  


3) **Wasted Ad Spend - a** common source of wasted ad spend comes from running too many broad or automatic discovery campaigns without proper negative targeting. To minimize wasted spend, limit your budget for these campaigns and implement strong negative targeting to keep waste at a minimum. I recommend getting a list of your competitor's name and using it negative-phrase target, this should be the bare minimum set up when it comes to negative targeting.

4) **Ranking Campaigns -** don’t be afraid to run ranking campaigns at a higher ACoS than average. For example, one of our campaigns ran at an ""unprofitable ACoS"" but helped us achieve strong product ranking and significant organic sales growth.

https://preview.redd.it/f7wjuor0usvd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c62587aa20dee46ce56f28dc229cee16071b289e

  
5) **Bids & Placements -** proper bid and placement optimization is the main lever in Amazon PPC. I recommend optimizing your ads 2-3 times a week or daily, while focusing on the highest converting placements in any campaign. Keep a close eye on your organic ranking and overall sales performance. Analyze weekly trends and adjust your campaigns accordingly

FulfillmentByAmazon,1g7lwhs,9,"Biggest metrics a seller needs to be mindful of: **40% ACOS, 20% TACOS** -- so more power to you if you have 50%+ margins in your unit economics, this can be a way to go.

FulfillmentByAmazon,1g5n186,5,"Sure, here’s a possible Reddit reply:

You’re absolutely spot on. As someone who has been following the evolution of both AI content and the Vine program, the shift is pretty obvious. The AI-written reviews often follow certain patterns—overly polished sentences, generic adjectives (like “exceptional,” “seamless,” “immersive”), and zero nuance about product flaws that real users tend to mention.

Amazon should care about this since fake or low-quality reviews erode consumer trust, but it’s tough to say how far they’ll go to fix it. Right now, the incentive is heavily tilted towards volume and maintaining engagement with Vine reviewers, not necessarily ensuring authenticity. Plus, with AI tools becoming accessible to anyone, many reviewers are just cranking out these automated reviews for the freebies without much thought.

I’d love to see Amazon integrate stricter moderation—maybe using behavioral signals to catch reviews that look too perfect or are generated too quickly. Or, they could flag users for review patterns like repetitive language or lack of specific product insights. That said, I wouldn’t hold my breath.

Ultimately, the onus is probably going to fall on us as shoppers to filter through the noise and lean on community-driven feedback or niche review sites.

PS: You nailed it with ""vibrant,"" ""holistic,"" and ""majestic."" If I see “holistic experience” in a mousepad review one more time... 😩

Here's a chart showing my data from 1 niche of products for a 4-month period. [https://i.imgur.com/rdUsCoi.png](https://i.imgur.com/rdUsCoi.png) Here's the same chart with 4 months of data after I implemented scheduled rules. [https://i.imgur.com/DsqBhKz.png](https://i.imgur.com/DsqBhKz.png)

Each of my campaigns were individually customized based on this report data. Considering that I'm always tweaking my campaigns in other ways too it's difficult to perfectly compare. My afternoons received the best improvements which is where I reduced my spend most. I also reduced my overnight bids but the ACOS didn't change much. I'll need to dig deeper and compare CPC for those time periods. It's also worth noting that my worst hours for ACOS are my least amount of spend as well, at only 7% of the days spend.

There are endless ways to analyze and tweak your campaigns. I'll revisit scheduled rules again once I have the same month against month comparison available.",LostMyMilk,"2024-10-20, 12:14, Sunday"

FulfillmentByAmazon,1g7yhky,1,"Hey there,

Great question! Dayparting can definitely be an effective strategy, especially if you’re noticing a clear trend in when your conversions are happening. Since you're a new seller, it’s good that you’re already tracking this data—it gives you a great foundation for making informed decisions.

Here are a few things to consider:

1. **Test Dayparting Gradually**: If most of your conversions are happening within a 6-hour window, it might be worth testing dayparting by setting up a start and end time for your campaigns during those hours. Just make sure to monitor performance closely after you implement the change, as it may affect your overall impressions and visibility.
2. **Buying Patterns**: It’s normal for conversions to spike in the evening because that’s when many shoppers are browsing, but this can vary by product category. Keep in mind that as your product gains more traction, buying behavior could shift over time, so it’s important to reassess periodically.
3. **Bid Adjustments**: For bid adjustments, it’s usually recommended to start with a moderate increase or decrease (like 10-20%) based on the times you’re seeing higher or lower performance. The goal is to maximize your ad spend during peak hours without cutting off potential sales during off-peak times entirely.
4. **Run an A/B Test**: You could also consider running an A/B test by comparing the performance of your PPC campaigns with and without dayparting. This way, you’ll have more concrete data to back up your decision.",ApplicationCalm7848,"2024-10-21, 04:04, Monday"

FulfillmentByAmazon,1g5uf7v,1,Are you wanting to run them side by side? My biggest tip is price parity across your items and keep the content slightly different for SEO.,_-undercoverlover-_,"2024-10-18, 08:46, Friday"
FulfillmentByAmazon,1g5uf7v,0,"I want to share my insights from my journey with online stores. Initially, I built my store on Magento. It was a complex system requiring specialized servers, costing me around $500 a month just for hosting. Edits to the website were cumbersome, and hiring developers was prohibitively expensive.

I then shifted to WooCommerce/WordPress. While it also necessitates servers, you can't rely on public servers; you need a VPS for reliable performance. Plus, you’ll need a merchant account for checkout, which adds even more development costs. If you lack development experience, this will quickly become a financial burden. Stay away from platforms like Wix and Squarespace. They may work for small sites, but they buckle under heavy traffic. The same goes for WooCommerce; a surge in traffic demands robust servers capable of scaling, which translates to higher expenses.

My first experience with Shopify was a migration from Magento back in 2012. I imported a little over 400,000 SKUs along with their content. To put in perspective, my Magento site was costing me around $1,500 a month just for server fees due to the volume of content and traffic. After migrating to Shopify, I was shocked by the speed of my new site. I called Shopify to confirm there hadn’t been a mistake, as my costs were just a few dollars a month. They explained that no matter if you have five products or 5,000, they allocate the same server resources to all clients.

I encountered issues during my initial setup, but Shopify's support resolved everything efficiently with one phone call. This experience solidified my belief that Shopify is a highly reliable website builder, standing strong against big players like Magento—all at an unbelievably low cost.

That said, be aware that Shopify does have substantial processing fees if you use Shopify Payments( I believe it's closer to 3 or 4%). In contrast, with WooCommerce or Magento, you can choose your own payment processor, paying only the interchange rate plus $0.10 (in most cases). While Shopify provides better user experience out of the box, custom builds may require hiring a developer, which can easily run into six figures.

What I appreciate about Shopify is its functionality as a CRM. It grants me detailed insights into customer data and allows for seamless integration of marketing tools. However, I have significant concerns regarding the app market. Many apps appear tempting, but it’s crucial to know who’s behind them and where your information is going. I've experienced data leaks due to backdoor access from app developers, so be diligent—avoid adding apps with only a handful of reviews and mediocre ratings.

Today, I’m recognized as a Shopify Partner. One of the major advantages of this role is the ability to set up stores in development mode, meaning you only pay once your store goes live, in the meantime you can build out your store as you wish. If you’re ready to explore the Shopify platform, I can provide you with a development store to build your site, and you can launch it whenever you choose.",Vincenzooos,"2024-10-17, 20:31, Thursday"
FulfillmentByAmazon,1g5uf7v,0,"I'm about to go on a similar journey myself. I have been selling on amazon since 2014. 

I'm branching out on my own shopify site in 2025. I'm B2C on amazon and sell below $10 on most goods.  My mode selling price is less than $10 per good sold and my average FBA fee is more than $3.

I've considered woo commerce, but selected shopify in interest of having details taken care of for me by the shopify platform (hosting, security, compliance). Additionally shopify is easy to work (easy to edit for a non developer like me). More importantly it has a great converting checkout. What i mean by a great converting checkout is that consumers reportedly are really comfortable, familiar, and willing to use the shopify checkout as opposed to all the other options available. 

For shipping, this is a big one. My goods take up a lot of space and are low value, so I had to get this right. I got myself  UPS business shipping account and am able to ship more cheaply than through a shipping service. This is really surprising to me and my point of contact at UPS. But Im at the extreme end of shipping dimensions. a 10""x10""x10"" package for me will way less than 5 pounds.

Here is my value proposition on Shopify. I can offer B2B competitive B2B pricing on my goods. While my goods are cheap to make and sell, they cost a lot to ship. The reason I am branching out B2B now (well in 2025) is because I found two solid suppliers that are able to produce my goods in really low moq for a reasonable price, and at expected standard moq but at a phenomenal price. So I will offer my goods and services and emphasize customization as a possiblity.

FulfillmentByAmazon,1g5fanq,2,"Are these people serious?? Why would they destroy your inventory just from nothing? Makes no sense to me, those are not clear answers, of course you can sell them, once you have unlocked from selling them with receipts is not a big deal, congratulations, go on with your business.
Restricted products can even be unlocked with a  white paper, believe me, or when you are an old account more and more products will be unlocked, without you having to send invoices. 

Selling books might be a risky business, but many people do the same as you do, the only way in which your books might be destroyed is if you sell some and some costumer complains that it is not original, “authenticity complains” so you have to prove that you product is original with invoices that you don’t have, if that happens then Amazon will then take your products to the trash because they don’t want anything to do with counterfeit.

Anyways is not a big deal, 
If I were you, I will not listen to those comments and first send some of those books to see how it goes, not many, you are just learning, so learning costs money and risks.

To all of the digital artists selling their art, I'm sorry that I defended AI users, even for a brief moment. I'm constantly being smacked in the face with terrible canva mash ups and Ai generated art because of these digital products gurus. I didn't think that it was bad but its terrible. It's all over etsy and im seeing so many Tiktok LIVES about step by step prompt details through Chat GPT, and teachings of how to sell them through POD.

I was looking for some artwork to hang in my bedroom (jungle theme) and I'm seeing tigers with confusing strips, crossing eyes, and extra toes... And that ""Ai glow"" is so off putting...So if you know any digital artist on etsy selling their work please drop it below.

EtsySellers,1g8ojga,95,"I am an artist on Etsy 😓 my prints and stickers are made in-house, and I've never used POD services or AI. The first few years of selling were actually amazing and my sales were consistent. But this year, even with all the promotional work I put in elsewhere, it dropped drastically off a cliff. The site is completely flooded with soulless AI work with prices I could never compete with and it feels so defeating. I've honestly been considering throwing in the towel on it all, but then I know there will be one less human artist on Etsy and that though depresses me too. I had hoped that Etsy would have a bit more integrity when it came to what they allow, but here we are. ",Spooky_Gecko,"2024-10-21, 08:57, Monday"

The funny thing is, I don't really feel sad—just tired (I tried advertisment, promotions, chasing tags, key words and stuff for a long time now).

EtsySellers,1g8ojga,5,"I really appreciate your attitude with this! I personally remember early on with Midjourney gaining in popularity I had some friends generating graphics for fun and I even gave them some prompts to try so I could enjoy some of the fun art. It never occurred to me then that people would use it to replace artists, it seemed no different than playing a video game.

As soon as I started seeing the first AI art on Etsy, though, I started getting nervous.

I do agree with those that Etsy trying to ban it would open up a can of worms because we'd have to police absolutely everything, but I do think more prominently flagged AI art and/or a way to filter out AI art would be amazing.",wartortlechortle,"2024-10-21, 10:01, Monday"
EtsySellers,1g8ojga,16,"I’ve got news for everyone. As a graphic designer for the past 20 years that sells on multiple platforms this sudden AI boom isn’t what has killed your sells. It has helped yes. But people have been using software to help create ‘art’ for a decade now. Ai is just the evolution. So if you’ve actually been selling and in the art community you’ve seen this slowly take over. It one hundred percent does not mean you should stop making art. Or that yours won’t sell. Make it known that your art is not AI and is original. And understand Covid had as much to do with the art scene as anything. When literal millions of people were stuck home and nothing to do or needing to make money from home they turned to pod sites and the like and started pumping out designs. I cannot blame them. This was nobody’s fault and I don’t blame people for trying to survive.  I feel like a better understanding of the situation helps dealing with the change in the world of art and how we need to learn to adapt and pivot to continue the art scene. There is and will continue to be a thirst for original art. Interesting people will always appreciate interesting and unique things. Take care, good luck and keep creating. It’s good for the soul.",Dixiedeadhead,"2024-10-21, 20:03, Monday"

There are people out there who don't have the ability to articulate what they'd like from an artist, but could spend a little time with an AI generator to at least get it close.

>I recently heard the news that Etsy will no longer allow 3rd party shipping integrations that are not Shippo or Shipstation (total BS if you ask me) but that they will allow anyone who is already set up to continue as usual. I love Pirate Ship and am worried that if/when I need to reenter my Etsy password (usually happens once or twice a year) it will not work. I just want to get ahead of the ball on this so it doesn't come as a surprise, especially with the busy season approaching....do you have any more details on what is going to happen?

For people who cannot access the Etsy forum, the relevant quote from PS Support was ""We're pretty confident these changes won't affect Pirate Ship's integration with Etsy, as our integration is not an Etsy app that is installed within an Etsy account. Instead, it's an integration installed in Pirate Ship directly that requires the purchase labels within our platform. As of now, we don't foresee any changes for those who currently use our Etsy integration or those who install the Etsy integration after this deadline.""",CindyLouWho_2,"2024-10-18, 01:41, Friday"
EtsySellers,1g6i2i3,74,"HELP!!!: I just got a MASSIVE order buying 15 of my items, some wiping out entire listings. I sell jewelry and gua shas and it’s an order for a bunch of my combs and guas. I have everything made to order and get them made in small quantities because it costs a lot for me to. I started cheering until I realized it was to Hong Kong. The amount is 323 with shipping, if something happens in shipping or whatever will Etsy purchase protection still cover it? I’m nervous someone is effectively going to wipe me out of my gua sha inventory and I’ll be on the hook for the financial loss GOD FORBID something happens in transit. What should I do I’m so nervous 

Update: I reached out and told him I would be cancelling the order and asked if he would be willing to make two transactions under 200 so they would be covered by Etsy Purchase Protection. He was totally kind and on board, shipped them out this afternoon. Took the chance, hope it all ends well lol. Thanks for your help everyone!",hellllllllloitsme,"2024-10-18, 09:28, Friday"
EtsySellers,1g6i2i3,66,"Etsy won't cover this one if it's lost as it's over 250. However, just ensure that you purchase the tracked and insured shipping.. If it gets lost you can make a claim with the shipping company and get your money refunded, but make sure that you get insured for the correct value of the package, and that you fill out all the information correctly. 

I did hear once that someone refunded the buyer and asked them to order it in two halves so that the value was lower, and then covered by Etsy. 

I'm torn on doing this, because i wouldn't want to bother the buyer to much.",Jolly-Adagio-8690,"2024-10-18, 09:37, Friday"
EtsySellers,1g6i2i3,9,"I personally would not exceed the $250 purchase protection as a seller. I’ve luckily never came across this yet. However, my plan would be to refund the items and ask the buyer to purchase separate. Idk. Call me pessimistic? 🤷‍♀️",djcat,"2024-10-18, 13:18, Friday"
EtsySellers,1g6i2i3,5,"no, I get you, I don't think I've ever exceeded a £250 order so it's fortunate for me, and i also haven't had to think about it much, and I wouldn't call it pessimistic, you're simply aware of the things that go wrong and you're protecting that.",Jolly-Adagio-8690,"2024-10-18, 15:57, Friday"

EtsySellers,1g6i2i3,1,"wow, that's crazy.

EtsySellers,1g6i2i3,3,"Highly doubt that they will ever buy any item, they using images to steal designs, I experienced that myself
But someone already mentioned, you need to decide which countries to sell to. Never do worldwide. I stopped shipping to Canada and especially German. German the worst in my experience, every second parcel lost or delivered to incorrect address.

EtsySellers,1g6i2i3,28,"I know you are excited, but sometimes it's not worth the stress. It's okay to refund the buyer, and say that you do not ship to Hong Kong. Also, a large shipment like that to HK makes me skeptical of their intentions. Why would they need 15 items? 

As a business owner, you still need to protect yourself mentally. It's okay to say no if this will cause you a lot of anxiety.",pastelpaintbrush,"2024-10-18, 11:03, Friday"

EtsySellers,1g9rjhg,75,"Etsy declined to refund buyer for Item Not Received Case: I'm posting this as an example of how Etsy seems to be cracking down on buyers who abuse Purchase Protection.

In this case, the order was delivered early this month. The buyer sent a Help Request 2 weeks later asking for a refund. I thought it was suspicious not so much because of the timing but more because they jumped straight to asking for a refund instead of a replacement. I sell niche products, and 99% of my buyers prefer a replacement if the package is lost.

They opened a case and got an instant reply from Etsy:

>After reviewing this case, we determined that a refund isn't appropriate in this situation.

>(Seller name), we appreciate your time and effort to assist the buyer.  
(Buyer name), thank you for using our case system and we're sorry you haven't received your (item).

>Keep in mind, abuse of Etsy's Purchase Protection program could result in program exclusion at Etsy's discretion.

Keeping in mind that Etsy identifies them as digital files right on the listing, 3 or the photos call this out as well as 2 different areas in the product description. Jeepers people.

I did not refund the first person as the files were downloaded immediately upon purchase. I explained that they were digital and I had confirmation of the download, and recommended they utilize a local print shop.

I’m likely going to refund the second one (and cancel the sale), as I truly believe they made an error.

I guess the next step is adding in the mandatory personalization to agree that it’s a digital file.

It's got to be said, some people simply shouldn't be allowed to shop online without supervision.

She gives me a guesstimate size and I’m like whatever at this point because she’s doing everything she can to not purchase a sizing kit for $2. She gets her order and says everything is entirely too big THEN she asks about my sizing kits. I send her the link, then tell her to reorder the actual set whenever she’s ready.
