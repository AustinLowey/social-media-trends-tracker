AMLO then sneakily put them under control of the military, and has been sending them a lot of work that should not be done by the military such as construction and such.  There are some high level officers becoming wealthy and powerful as a result, and are not under any sort of civilian control or bound by standards.  That's one reason why a lot of critics are claiming that the Mayan train is dangerous for example.  Overall, this has resulted in what appears to be an increase in corruption and the national guard has been less effective against cartels and murders than the previous federal police were.",
